# EscapeCounter
Simple Electron tray app to count how many times escape has been pressed.

### There's no ESCAPE!

When apple announced it's Macbook Pro 2016 the main concern from developers was the lack of Escape key. 
But, how much do we use the escape key? Escape counter is the answe. 

Note: I made this in about 30 minutes... so it's very raw and not much functionality. It's just a funny joke about 
the lack of escape key on the new MBP pro.

Here's a sreenshot of the app:
